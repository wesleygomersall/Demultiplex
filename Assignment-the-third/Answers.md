final work will be submitted on [GitHub in the Assignment-the-Third folder](.). Make sure your folder is well organized and final output is clearly labeled/summarized (a markdown file would be much appreciated!!). Use your code to demultiplex the samples and report:

- Percentage of reads from each sample
- Overall amount of index swapping
- Any figures/any other relevant data your code output

Paste slurm output here and calculate the answers.
